# Daily Breifing

**Daily Breifing** is an expandable, and _super_ sipmle random picker. I use it to randomnly pick a GTK and Icon theme every morning, as well as to remind me of my todo list.

It's _stupidly_ simple, feel free to use it if you like, it's easily adaptable, but I don't know why you would â˜º.
